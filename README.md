Due to/due from accounting lets you use one fund to pay another fund's obligations by tracking which fund owes another fund and which fund the money is due to. The general ledger is the centralized source that contains all of the financial accounts for a company. It contains debit and credit accounts, including the due to account, which is a credit account.
